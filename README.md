# UFOs

## Overview of Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this challenge was to build a table using data stored in a Javascript array.  The array stored in the table was then to be presented on a webpage.  Four files were used to accomplish this task: app.js(for the application), data.js(javascript array), index.html(web design), style.css(web design). Filter option were designed in the html file and the filters were able to process through the app.js file.  Everything worked together to present a clear, crisp and functional webpage.

## Resources
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Data Source: data.js
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Software: javascript, html, bootstrap, css


### Results
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon running the html file on a chrome browser I was able to conduct searches for certain criteria. After inserting the criteria in the respective filter and then pressing enter, results are produced to the right.  Here are three examples of the code functioning properly:

### Summary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project shows how javascript loops and functions, working together with html and bootstrap, can create a clean and organized webpage.  One drawback of Javascript is that different browsers sometimes interpret Javasript code differently so the output could vary slightly.  Two recommendations for further development of this project would be:
<br />
* a bigger database spanning more years and locations
* links to specific encounters with pictures and followup research
